The service you want to use needs to be injected. You can use either the Fixer provider I created in EPi.Libraries.Commerce.ExchangeRates.Fixer. 
Or write your own for the service you would like to use. In that case you will need to implement IExchangeRateService 
and add the following attribute to your class  [ServiceConfiguration(typeof(IExchangeRateService), Lifecycle = ServiceInstanceScope.Singleton)]
